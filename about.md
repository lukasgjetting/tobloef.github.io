Hi, I'm Tobias LÃ¸fgren, a 19-year old software developer from Denmark. When I'm not going to school or working as a freelance software developer, I like to tinker with all sorts of fun side projects. It's mostly programming related, but I also sometimes do CTFs and other security related things. This site is still in its early stages but I plan to use it as a place to host my personal blog and portfolio.
