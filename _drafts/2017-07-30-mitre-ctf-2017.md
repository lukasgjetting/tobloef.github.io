A couple of weeks ago I participated in the 2017 MITRE STEM Cyber Challenge CTF, and now I've finally gotten around to setting up this blog and doing a writeup for the challenges I solved. Overall me and my teammate managed to get 1150 points, placing us at a shared 5th on the scoreboard.

Before starting the CTF I had decided to mostly focus on challenges in the forensics and miscellaneous categories, but I also ended up doing a web and a crypto challenge. The other two challenges my team did, Web 100 and Web 150, was solved by my teammate and thus the solutions won't be posted here.

Unfortunately the challenge titles and descriptions are no longer available, and I didn't think to save them before the CTF ended, so I'll only be able to post the solutions, not the challenges they're for.

Also, this is my first CTF writeup, so feel free to let me know I if you have any feedback.

# Forensics 50
[Click here to download the challenge .pcap file](/assets/mitre-ctf-2017/forensics-50.pcap)

In this challenge we were given a .pcap file, which I opened up in Wireshark to take a closer look. There are just five packets, seemingly a user receiving an email. To get a better overview of what was sent, right-clicked on a packet and choose Follow -> TCP Stream.

We see what seems to be a password reset email for some non-existing site. The only thing of interest is the token from the password reset url: `TUNBezU4MDc2MjY2NzZ9`. Since it's just a bogus url for a non-existing website and we don't have anymore packets, it's safe to assume that the flag is hidden in the token. I tried decoding it as base64, which turned out to be correct, revealing the flag. Without the base64 padding it was harder to recognize, but I was lucky and got it on first try.

**Flag:** `MCA{5807626676}`

# Forensics 100
[Click here to download the challenge .zip file](/assets/mitre-ctf-2017/forensics-100.zip)

In this challenge we were given a zip-fil. Let's unzip it and take a look at its contents:

{% highlight text %}
$ unzip forensics-100.zip
Archive:  forensics-100.zip
  inflating: HDD_1.vhd
  inflating: HDD_3.vhd
  inflating: HDD_4.vhd
  inflating: HDD_5.vhd
{% endhighlight %}

We can see that the .zip file contains 5 .vhd (Virtual Hard Disk) files. Let's do a quick binwalk on the files to see if they contain anything useful:

{% highlight text %}
$ binwalk -e *.vhd

Scan Time:     2017-10-01 02:14:25
Signatures:    193
Target File:   HDD_1.vhd
MD5 Checksum:  8c02caf7e310120f8f51da5e92f97a80

DECIMAL         HEX             DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1662464         0x195E00        PNG image, 1055 x 524, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
{% endhighlight %}

We can see that binwalk found a few embedded files, including a couple of .png files. Binwalk didn't extract the .png files, so let's specify that binwalk should extract the .png files:

{% highlight text %}
$ binwalk -eD 'png image:png' *.vhd
{% endhighlight %}

Now we have the extracted image file, shown below:

**Flag:** `MCA{RA1D3rs_0f_the_L0sT_bits}`

# Web 50

In this challenge we were given a link that lead to a webpage with dog facts. At the bottom of the page we can see a message which seemingly contained the flag:

> Most doggos have 4 legs Many doggos have collars with their name or ID number on a tag. The most common tag number is, MCA{C0PYING_1z_d@ng3r0us}. no one really knows why this is such a popular number Doggos make good friends

But if we try to just copy the flag, something is messing with our clipboard and the copied piece of text won't actually be the flag. We can easily circumvent this by viewing the website's source and copying the flag from there.

**Flag:** `MCA{C0PYING_1z_d@ng3r0us`

# Crypto 150
